# arkrconandupdater
This tool can restart and update your Ark Server automatically (at the moment only time-based) and allows sending broadcasts/chat messages in intervals or at a specific time.

Important: This tool was made to work with Ark Survival Launcher/Ark Remote. At the moment it's only possible to use it with another program if this starts the Ark Server automatically on startup.

At the moment the gui looks pretty ugly, but the most things are working correctly (i hope).

Features:

  -restarts and updates your server at a specific time or interval (optional warning messages before restart, saves world, kills process, launches steamcmd, updates server and launches Ark Remote or other program again)
  -broadcasts messages via broadcast or chat at a specific time or in a specific interval
  
  Planned Features:
  
  
  -Automatic updating if update was found (intelligent break and warnings before update if players are on server)
